# Contributing to copilot-chat.vim
Contributions are what makes the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

## House rules
- Before submitting a new issue or PR, check if it already exists in issues or PRs.

## Developing
The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull requests should be made against.

To develop locally:
1. Fork this repository on your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local device
2. Create a new branch
```
git checkout -b my_new_branch
```
3. Make changes in repo as required
4. Run `move.sh` to save changes to plugin location for testing

## Testing
Tests are written with vader and include the necessary mocking in `mocks.vader` to avoid the need token generation

### Running tests
```
vim '+Vader! test/*' && echo Success || echo Failure
```

## Linting
Linting is done with `vint`. This is a linter for Vim scripts that checks for common mistakes and style issues.
To install `vint`, you must have Python 3 installed. You can install `vint` using pip:

```
pip install setuptools vint
```

To check the formatting of your code:
```
vint .
```
If you get errors be sure to fix them before committing.

## Making a Pull Request
- If your PR refers to or fixes an issue, be sure to add `fixes #XXX` to the PR description. Replacing `XXX` with the respective issue number.

## Maintainer Merge Policy (for maintainers only)
To ensure a clean and linear commit history, we follow a rebase-and-push policy. Maintainers do not use GitHub's "Merge Pull Request" button.

### How maintainers merge PRs
1. Fetch the contributorâ€™s branch
```
git remote add contributor https://github.com/username/their-fork.git
git fetch contributor
git checkout -b pr-branch contributor/branch-name
```
2. Rebase onto `main` (squash / reword as needed `git rebase -i origin/main`)
3. Push to `main`
```
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only pr-branch
git push origin main
```
4. Close open PR on GitHub with comment referencing the commit
